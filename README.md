# AutomataConformance
This repository contains the open source code for my PhD project about determining conformance in process mining in a more scalable way. The technique involves comparing automata structures representing the event log and the process model. Additionally, several improvements have been impemented: Parallelism in process models is broken down in a divide-and-conquer approach based on S-Components. Repeated sequences in the event log are reduced via tandem repeats to further speed up computation.
